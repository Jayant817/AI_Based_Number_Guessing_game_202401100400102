# AI_Based_Number_Guessing_game_202401100400102
This Python code implements a classic number guessing game. It begins by generating a random integer within a defined range, the secret number. The program then enters a loop, repeatedly prompting the player to input their numerical guess. After each guess, the code compares the player's input to the secret number, providing feedback by indicating whether the guess is "Higher" or "Lower." If the guess matches the secret number, the loop terminates, and the program congratulates the player, displaying the total number of guesses taken. Input validation is included to handle cases where the player enters non-numerical data, ensuring the program's robustness. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the secret number.
